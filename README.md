python-img-generator
========

This project is intended to generate phrases of random words as images.
One of the main usages involves automatic text recognition.

The whole thing is packaged as a docker image, so you don't have any issues with your current python version

# building

```
$ build-image.sh
```

# running

```
$ run-image.sh
```

You then now have a new shining `content\images` folder with the generated files.
